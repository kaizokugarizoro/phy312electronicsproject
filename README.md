# PHY 312 Advanced Electronics and Instrumentation Lab Project
## Modelling Piezoelectric Devices as Both Transmitters and Receivers

In this project, we model a piezoelectric transducer as a transmitter and a receiver of acoustic pressure signals. By applying an input voltage to the piezoelectric transducer, we can induce stress in the material. This induced stress, in turn, _transmits_ acoustic pressure waves inside the water domain. These waves travel upwards till they reflect from the rigid top walls and arrive back at the top surface of the transducer. The pressure waves cause the material to deform under stress again, which induces a voltage signal at the top surface of the transducer, and thus it acts as a _receiver_.

The project was carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6.0.280. The mph files can be found [here](https://github.com/kaizokugarizoro/phy312electronicsproject/blob/main/project_file_comsol.mph), and the GIFs and plots of the simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/kaizokugarizoro/phy312electronicsproject/tree/main/images%20and%20gifs).
